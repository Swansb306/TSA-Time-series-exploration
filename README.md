# TSA-Time-series-exploration
This takes tsa data that I previously used in my previous tsa project and uses some time series techniques to try to predict how many people go through tsa in a week. I worked on this because there is a market in Kalshi for predicting TSA checkins and I thought it would be fun to build something simple to begin trying to model this.
